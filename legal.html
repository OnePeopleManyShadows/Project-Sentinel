<h1>Legal & Ordination</h1>
<p>I am an ordained minister through the Universal Life Church (ULC), recognized under U.S. constitutional protections.</p>
<p>Services offered are either secular (life strategy, document coaching) or spiritual (ceremonial or soul-based), clearly delineated. I do not practice psychotherapy. All participants engage voluntarily and with informed respect.</p>
